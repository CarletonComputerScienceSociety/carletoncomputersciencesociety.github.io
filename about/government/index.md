  <h1>Governance</h1>

  <p>The CCSS strives to be a transparent and accessible organization for all Carleton University computer science students and community members interested in how we function and the work we do. This page contains links to all the important documents regarding our governance.</p>
  <h3>Our Constitution</h3>
  <p>The CCSS Constitution defines the basic rules that the Society must abide by to remain in control of its assets, dissolution and operation procedures for the Society. We are required to hold a general meeting to change this document.

  <h3>Our Rules of Operation</h3>
  <p>The rules of operation are rules that the board of directors can change during a meeting as long as the society members are notified. You can find them <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GdX5OPCI5gdbViDAfCIbFto6tgNxH-gwHzLy9e2S3o8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>
