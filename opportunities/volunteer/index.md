    <p>The CCSS team is super excited to get the year started with a variety of fantastic events and amazing initiatives! Volunteering with the CCSS is a great way to meet your fellow CS peers, develop interpersonal & technical skills, share opportunities & resources with other students, get involved in the CS community, and a lot more!</p>
    <p>Please note that the number of hours/week varies depending on the scope of the project. We understand that it can be difficult for students to balance school, work, and extracurricular activities at the same time. With this in mind, we do our best to allow our volunteers to have flexibility in the initiatives they decide to implement while still being able to get involved!</p>
