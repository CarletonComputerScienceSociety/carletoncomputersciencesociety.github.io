    <h3>Changes to the Winter 2021 Academic Schedule</h3>
    <p>In order to allow you more time to enjoy the holiday season and to rest between terms, the university is delaying the start of the winter 2021 term from Wednesday, Jan. 6 to Monday, Jan. 11, 2021.</p>
    <p>Earlier this week, the Senate Committee on Curriculum, Admission, and Studies Policy approved the following adjustments to the winter 2021 academic term:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Monday, Jan. 11, 2021: Winter term begins.</li>
    <li>Monday, Jan. 25, 2021: Last day for registration for winter term courses.</li>
    <li>Wednesday, Apr. 14, 2021: Winter term ends. Last day of fall/winter and winter term classes. Classes follow a Friday schedule.</li>
    <li>April 16-27, 2021: Final examinations in winter term and fall/winter courses may be held. Examinations are normally held all seven days of the week.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please review the Registrar’s Office website for a complete list of <a href="https://carleton.ca/registrar/registration/dates-and-deadlines/">dates and deadlines</a> for the winter 2021 term.</p>
    <p>If you haven’t already done so, we encourage you to register now for the winter term. There are still spaces available in a wide variety of courses, and registration continues until Jan. 24, 2021. As you will see in Carleton Central, we are continuing to work with academic departments and course instructors to provide more comprehensive information in the course comments section regarding the nature of course delivery.</p>
    <p>We understand that studying online may be a different experience for many students, but it also provides a flexible environment that is suitable for people with busy schedules or those who are no longer residing in the Ottawa area who wish to complete their degrees. If you have questions about your academic progress, outstanding courses required for your program, or options for completing your degree, we invite you to contact the <a href="https://carleton.ca/academicadvising/">Academic Advising Centre</a>.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re working your way through the fall term, or preparing to return to Carleton this winter, we encourage you to visit <a href="https://students.carleton.ca/online/">Carleton's Current Students website</a> to find an extensive list of support services available to our students online.</p>

    <h2>New SAT Grading Winter 2021</h2>
    Information enclosed:
    <ul>
    <li>New Winter 2021 SAT grading approved for undergraduate students</li>
    <li><a href="https://carleton.ca/registrar/sat-request/?utm_source=studentportal&utm_medium=message&utm_campaign=wintersat">SAT Request Form</a> for Fall 2020 available Dec. 14, 2020</li>
    <li>More information on the <a href="https://carleton.ca/academicadvising/faqs-about-sat-uns/?utm_source=studentportal&utm_medium=message&utm_campaign=wintersat">SAT/UNS FAQ webpage</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a follow up to the message regarding the use of <a href="https://students.carleton.ca/2020/11/sat-uns-grade-designation-information/?utm_source=studentportal&utm_medium=message&utm_campaign=wintersat">flexible, compassionate grading options for undergraduate students in the Fall 2020 and Winter 2021 terms</a>, the Carleton University Senate has approved the use of Satisfactory (SAT) grading for the Winter 2021 term. Specifically, Senate has approved the optional conversion of one 0.5 credit grade to SAT for the Winter 2021 term. This would be in addition to the 0.5 credit grade available to you in the Fall 2020 term that Senate passed in October, allowing for a maximum of 1.0 credit to be converted to SAT during the Fall-Winter 2020/21 terms.</p>
    <p>In other words, you will now be able to request to designate one 0.5 credit passing grade to SAT in the Fall 2020 term and one 0.5 credit passing grade to SAT in the Winter 2021 term. Alternatively, you may instead request that a passing grade for one full year (fall/winter) 1.0 credit is converted to SAT in the Winter 2021 term.</p>
    <p>If you choose to request the alternative notation of SAT, you will still be required to meet the minimum prerequisite grades for future courses, regardless of whether the grade has been replaced by the alternative notation. The original letter grade will remain accessible to the University for internal purposes only but will not appear on your transcript or be used in the calculation of CGPA. The SAT Request Form for 0.5 credit Fall 2020 courses will be made available on the <a href="https://carleton.ca/registrar/sat-request/?utm_source=studentportal&utm_medium=message&utm_campaign=wintersat">Registrar’s Office website</a> on Dec. 14, 2020.</p>
    <p><a href="https://students.carleton.ca/2020/11/sat-uns-grade-designation-information/?utm_source=studentportal&utm_medium=message&utm_campaign=wintersat">As previously communicated</a>, except for failing grades assigned as a result of an academic integrity violation, Fail (F) grades will automatically be converted to UNS by the Registrar’s Office for Fall 2020 and Winter 2021 term courses.</p>
    <p>Please see the <a href="https://carleton.ca/academicadvising/faqs-about-sat-uns/?utm_source=studentportal&utm_medium=message&utm_campaign=wintersat">SAT/UNS FAQ</a> webpage that covers a variety of questions and information relating to SAT/UNS. We encourage you to carefully review this webpage before making your decision to designate any of your grades as SAT. If you have additional questions regarding the SAT/UNS designation, please contact academicadvising@carleton.ca to meet with an academic advisor virtually.</p>
