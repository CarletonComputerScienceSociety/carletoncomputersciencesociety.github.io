This scholarship should be automatically applied to your account by the beginning of your first semester. After every year if you will be required to maintain a certain grade average for your scholarship to be renewed.

    <p>If you are a student who has not been awarded a renewable entrance scholarship at the time of admission, you will be considered for an in-course scholarship for the following year. In-course scholarships are awarded to students who meet the academic and course load requirements for awarding a scholarship and who are proceeding from one year to the next.
