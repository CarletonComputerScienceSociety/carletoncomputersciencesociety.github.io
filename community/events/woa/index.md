So why not make that experience the best it could possibly be? The CCSS wants you to succeed in your studies, and that means making sure your workspace works for you! At this Week of Awesome Talk, we will cover the basics of desktop organization, ergonomics, and good work habits to keep you physically and mentally healthy.</div>
