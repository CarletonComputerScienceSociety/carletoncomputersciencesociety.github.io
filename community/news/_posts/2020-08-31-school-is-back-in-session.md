<b>Hey everyone!</b> Fall semester is right around the corner - we hope you are all excited to start the new academic year! We've got a lot of news to share with you all - read on for all <b>the latest CCSS updates!</b>

<h4><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/3268190949931309">CS Clubs and Societies Info Sessions</a></h4>

Are you an incoming or returning CS student <b>looking to get involved this year, but not sure how?</b> Well, look no further! The CCSS is collaborating with <b>ALL clubs and societies affiliated with the School of Computer Science (SCS)</b> to bring you an exciting, virtual <b>CS Clubs & Societies Information Session!</b>

We will hold two identical sessions: one on <b>Sunday, September 13 at 1:00 pm EDT</b> and one on <b>Saturday, September 19 at 9:00 am EDT.</b> Each club and society will speak for approximately 5 minutes, and there will be a 30-minute Q&A session at the end.
An email will be going out to all CS students soon with information on all participating clubs and a Microsoft Teams link to the event. <b>We hope to see you all there!</b>

<h4>Q&A from Far Away - International Students Panel</h4>

<b>Are you an international student</b> coming to Carleton for the first time this year? Whether you're here for a short time on exchange or starting the multi-year journey of completing a degree, <b>the CCSS wants you to feel welcomed</b> in our community!

Please join us on <b>Monday, September 7 from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM EDT</b> to attend a panel of fellow international students ranging from 2nd to 4th year, who chose to study computer science at Carleton, just like you! They will be talking about their <b>experiences as international students in CS</b> and <b>answering any questions or concerns that you may have!</b> We will also have a representative from the <b>International Student Services Office (ISSO)</b> who will be doing a short presentation on all the resources Carleton has to offer you.

This panel will take place in Microsoft Teams. You will be able to access the event during the scheduled date and time via <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/dl/launcher/launcher.html?type=meetup-join&deeplinkId=01fd131a-a53c-40f6-9200-623c2ff8013d&directDl=true&msLaunch=true&enableMobilePage=true&url=%2F_%23%2Fl%2Fmeetup-join%2F19%3Ameeting_NmI3NjhlMzUtMWJhNS00NDg0LWFkNGYtYTBiMmI5NTNmYzM3@thread.v2%2F0%3Fcontext%3D%257b%2522Tid%2522%253a%25226ad91895-de06-485e-bc51-fce126cc8530%2522%252c%2522Oid%2522%253a%25228f673cc7-c6a0-4fba-abe4-237b3a53eb2f%2522%257d%26anon%3Dtrue&suppressPrompt=true">this Teams link</a>.

<h4>First-Year Representative Elections</h4>

If you're in your first year of CS at Carleton and looking for a way to <b>get involved with the CCSS,</b> here is a great opportunity!

We are looking for two passionate individuals to <b>join our exec team as first-year representatives</b> for the 2020-2021 academic year. The first-year rep positions are a chance for first-year students to <b>take part in the governance of the CCSS.</b> This means participating in <b>internal meetings,</b> being involved in the creation and planning of our <b>events and initiatives,</b> and having voting power in <b>all important decisions</b> for the year.

Nominations will begin on <b>Tuesday, September 8</b> - make sure to keep checking your Carleton email so you don't miss the nomination form! <b>More info will be coming soon!</b>

<h4>CCSS Dev Club</h4>

Do you have <b>ideas for personal coding projects</b> but aren't sure how to get started? Do you want to <b>practice skills that you've learned in class</b> in fun ways with your peers? Are you interested in <b>learning more about tech</b> and its real-world applications? If so, check out <b>CCSS's Dev Club!</b>

Starting on <b>Wednesday, September 23,</b> Dev Club will run weekly at <b>6:00 PM Eastern Time</b> on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/VdxStVE">CCSS Discord server</a>. Meetings will alternate between </b>group discussion sessions</b> (where students will have the opportunity to <b>share their ideas,</b> make progress on their own <b>side projects,</b> and participate in <b>fun coding activities</b>), and <b>tech talks</b> hosted by knowledgeable <b>student volunteers</b>.

All this and even more to come for the rest of the year! As always, you can reach us by email via <a href="mailto:info@ccss.carleton.ca">info@ccss.carleton.ca</a> if you have any questions, suggestions, or concerns. We wish you all the best in the Fall semester. See you at <b>Academic Orientation!</b>
