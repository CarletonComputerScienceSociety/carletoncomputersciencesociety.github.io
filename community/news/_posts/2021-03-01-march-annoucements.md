<p>Speed Friending returns once again! This event will give you all a chance to meet new friends in Carleton CS and build quick bonds with them.

<h3 >Virtual Prof Social (Friday, March 26 at 12pm)</h3  >
<p>One of the most popular recurring CCSS events is Prof Night - where we have historically invited SCS faculty to socialize with students at Mike's Place Pub on campus. Since we can't meet in-person, this year's version of the student-prof social will be taking place on Zoom! Students and faculty members will have a chance to mingle with one another in a number of breakout rooms. At regular intervals, participants will be prompted to switch rooms and continue the conversation with new faces!</p>
<p>This event will take place on Friday, March 26 from 12:00 to 2:00 PM EST, through Zoom. The link to attend will be shared in a separate email, so keep an eye on your inbox!</p>

<h3 >SCS Feedback Survey Report</h3  >
<p>We asked, you answered! Last term, we noticed many students struggling to adapt to the new online paradigm of learning. To help with this, we decided to collect an assortment of qualitative and quantitative feedback from you all, to share with the School of Computer Science with hopes that it could result in improvements to online course delivery. We received an overwhelming amount of feedback and support for this initiative, so thank you to everyone who responded!</p>
<p>The CCSS compiled all of your responses into a report that was submitted to the SCS faculty at the beginning of the Winter semester. The public version of the report has now been made available on the CCSS website! If you are interested in reading it for yourself, you can check it out <a href="http://ccss.carleton.ca/community/news/blog/feedback-and-suggestions-survey/">here</a>. The password can be accessed via the email you received from the School of Computer Science.
