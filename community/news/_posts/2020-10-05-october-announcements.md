<h2>Announcements from the CCSS - October 2020</h2>

<p><b>Hello everyone!</b> We hope you've been making a successful transition into <b>remote learning</b> this semester. Oh, how time flies - it feels like we've only just started the term, and yet we're already approaching the <b>spookiest</b> time of the Fall: <b>midterm season!</b> Well, not to fear; CCSS is here, and we have some good stuff in store for you all! Here are some <b>updates</b> from us for the month of October.</p>

<h2>Fall General Meeting</h2>

<p>Every Fall and Winter term, the <b>Carleton Computer Science Society</b> organizes a general meeting open to all CCSS members. At the meeting, we discuss <b>the goal of the society</b> and its operations, <b>vote on any proposed changes to the Constitution</b>, and <b>allow members to ask society-related questions</b> directly to the Board of Directors. This semester, we will be holding our Fall General Meeting on <b>Thursday, October 22 at 8:30 PM</b>.</p>

The meeting will take place virtually on <b>Microsoft Teams</b>. The link to attend will be sent in a <b>separate email</b>, along with the meeting agenda. <b>All CCSS members (that's you!)</b> are encouraged to attend the general meeting to <b>be well-informed</b> about the activities of the society.
